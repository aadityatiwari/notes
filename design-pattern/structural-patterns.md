| [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) or Wrapper or Translator | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.
| [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern)                            | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.                                                                                                                                                    
| [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)                      | Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.                                                                           
| [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)                      | Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.                                                              
| Extension object                                                                  | Adding functionality to a hierarchy without changing the hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                         
| [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)                            | Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.                                                                                         
| [Flyweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern)                      | Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                       
| [Front controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller)                | The pattern relates to the design of Web applications. It provides a centralized entry point for handling requests.                                                                                                                         
| [Marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern)                  | Empty interface to associate metadata with a class.                                                                                                                                                                                         
| [Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)                            | Group several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity.                                                                                                                       
| [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern)                              | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                                                                                                                                                             
| [Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_pattern)                                | Twin allows modeling of multiple inheritance in programming languages that do not support this feature.                                                                                                                                     



The **structural design patterns** are [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)) that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

>[Adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern): 'adapts' one interface for a class into one that a client expects
>-   Adapter pipeline: Use multiple adapters for debugging purposes.
>
>-   Retrofit Interface Pattern: An adapter used as a new interface for multiple classes at the same time.
>
>[Aggregate pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_pattern): a version of the [Composite pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) with methods for aggregation of children
>
>[Bridge pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern): decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
>
>[Composite pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern): a tree structure of objects where every object has the same interface
>
>[Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern): add additional functionality to a class at runtime where sub-classing would result in an exponential rise of new classes
>
>[Extensibility pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility_pattern): aka. Framework - hide complex code behind a simple interface
>
>[Facade pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern): create a simplified interface of an existing interface to ease usage for common tasks
>
>[Flyweight pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern): a large quantity of objects share a common properties object to save space
>
>[Marker pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern): an empty interface to associate metadata with a class.
>
>[Proxy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern): a class functioning as an interface to another thing

| [Active Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object)                               | Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using [asynchronous method invocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_method_invocation) and a [scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) for handling requests. |
| [Balking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balking_pattern)                                   | Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Binding properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_properties_pattern)             | Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.                                                                                                                                |
| [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database))                          | Decentralized way to store data and agree on ways of processing it in a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), optionally using [Digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) for any individual contributions.                                                                                  |
| [Double-checked locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_checked_locking_pattern)     | Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed. Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Event-based asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-Based_Asynchronous_Pattern) | Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Guarded suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_suspension)                     | Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-pattern)                                         | Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model.                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science))                              | One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Messaging design pattern (MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern)          | Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Monitor object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization))                  | An object whose methods are subject to [mutual exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion), thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.                                                                                                                                            |
| [Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern)                                   | A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Read-write lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read/write_lock_pattern)                   | Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduler_pattern)                               | Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern)                           | A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the [object pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool) pattern.                                                                         |
| [Thread-specific storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-Specific_Storage)           | Static or "global" memory local to a thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing))
---------

**Scheduling** is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work.

Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in [load balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service).

Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and scheduling makes it possible to have [computer multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking) with a single [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU).

A scheduler may aim at one of many goals like maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, minimizing latency, maximizing fairness.

The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. 

It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as *[preemptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)) scheduler*, otherwise it is a *[cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpreemptive_multitasking) scheduler* where processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle.

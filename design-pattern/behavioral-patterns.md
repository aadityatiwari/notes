| [Blackboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_(design_pattern))                                                            | [Artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) pattern for combining disparate sources of data (see [blackboard system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system))                                                           
| [Chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility_pattern)                                           | Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.                                                    
| [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern)                                                                           | Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests. It also allows for the support of undoable operations.                                                      
| [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern)                                                                   | Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

Mediator promotes [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to vary independently. 
| [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern)                                                                           | Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

| [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) or [Publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe) | Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.                                                                                                            
| [Servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_Servant)                                                                    | Define common functionality for a group of classes.

| [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)                                                                               | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.                                                                                                          
| [Template method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)                                                           | Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.                                                           
| [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)                                                                           | Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets a new operation be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.                                                                             



The **behavioral design patterns** identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Examples of this type of design pattern include:
>- [Chain of responsibility pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility_pattern): Command objects are handled or passed on to other objects by logic-containing processing objects
>- [Command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern): Command objects encapsulate an action and its parameters
>- "Externalize the Stack": Turn a recursive function into an iterative one that uses a stack
>- [Interpreter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern): Implement a specialized computer language to rapidly solve a specific set of problems
>- [Iterator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern): Iterators are used to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
>- [Mediator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern): Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
>- [Memento pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern): Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (rollback)
>- [Null Object pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern): Designed to act as a default value of an object
>- [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern): a.k.a. Publish/Subscribe or Event Listener. Objects register to observe an event that may be raised by another object
>- Weak reference pattern: De-couple an observer from an observable
>- [Protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack): Communications are handled by multiple layers, which form an encapsulation hierarchy
>- [Scheduled-task pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled-task_pattern): A task is scheduled to be performed at a particular interval or clock time (used in [real-time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing))
>- [Single-serving visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_visitor_pattern): Optimise the implementation of a visitor that is allocated, used only once, and then deleted
>- [Specification pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern): Recombinable business logic in a [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) fashion
>- [State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern): A clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime
>- [Strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern): Algorithms can be selected on the fly
>- [Template method pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern): Describes the [program skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_skeleton) of a program
>- [Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern): A way to separate an algorithm from an object

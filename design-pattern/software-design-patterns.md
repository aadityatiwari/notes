[Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
----------

A software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns reside in the domain of modules and interconnections.

At a higher level there are architectural patterns which are larger in scope, usually describing an overall pattern followed by an entire system.

Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

Design patterns were originally
-	Grouped into the categories:
    -  [creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
    -  [structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)
    -  [behavioral patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)
    -  [concurrency patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_pattern)

-	Described using the concepts of
    -  [delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(programming))
    -  [aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregation_(object-oriented_programming))
    -  consultation

It's a broad topic and to get a better understanding we need to dig deeper at an individual pattern level. 

Instead of putting up everything at one place, I have prepared separate study notes on most of the popular design patterns so that we can jump directly over to a particular design pattern and take a quick bite on it. 

Please refer to my individual notes for further details on various software design patterns.

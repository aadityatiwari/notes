----------------

-   x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant.

-   The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.

-   The term "x86" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in "86", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.

-   Many additions and extensions have been added to the x86 instruction set over the years, almost consistently with full backward compatibility.

-   As of 2017, the majority of personal computers and laptops sold are based on the x86 architecture (despite inroads from Chromebook-style ARM designs, the segment-leading Apple MacBook family remains exclusively x86), while other categories—especially high-volume mobile categories such as smartphones or tablets—are dominated by ARM; at the high end, x86 continues to dominate compute-intensive workstation and cloud computing segments.

-   In 1985, Intel released the 32-bit 80386 (later known as i386) which gradually replaced the earlier 16-bit chips in computers (although typically not in embedded systems) during the following years; this extended programming model was originally referred to as the i386 architecture.

-   In 1999-2003, AMD extended this 32-bit architecture to 64 bits and referred to it as x86-64 in early documents and later as AMD64.

-   Many Linux distributions uses the term "amd64" to refer to 64 bit architecture.

-   Microsoft Windows, designates its 32-bit versions as "x86" and 64-bit versions as "x64"

-   The x86 architecture is a variable instruction length, similar to "CISC" design with emphasis on backward compatibility. Byte-addressing is enabled and words are stored in memory with little-endian byte order.

-   **x86-64** (also known as x64, x86\_64 and AMD64) is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set.

-   It supports vastly larger amounts (theoretically, 2<sup>64</sup> bytes or 16 exbibytes) of virtual memory and physical memory than is possible on its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to store larger amounts of data in memory.

-   x86-64 also provides 64-bit general-purpose registers and numerous other enhancements. It is fully backward compatible with the 16-bit and 32-bit x86 code.

[Generics in Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Generics were added to Java in 2004 within the official version J2SE 5.0

The [Java collections framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_collections_framework) supports generics to specify the type of objects stored in a collection instance.

According to *Java Language Specification*:

-   A **type variable** is an unqualified identifier. Type variables are introduced by generic class declarations, generic interface declarations, generic method declarations, and by generic constructor declarations.

-   A **class** is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the type parameters of the class. It defines one or more type variables that act as parameters. A generic class declaration defines a set of parameterized types, one for each possible invocation of the type parameter section. All of these parameterized types share the same class at runtime.

-   An **interface** is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the type parameters of the interface. It defines one or more type variables that act as parameters. A generic interface declaration defines a set of types, one for each possible invocation of the type parameter section. All parameterized types share the same interface at runtime.

-   A **method** is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the formal type parameters of the method. The form of the formal type parameter list is identical to a type parameter list of a class or interface.

-   A **constructor** can be declared as generic, independently of whether the class that the constructor is declared in is itself generic. A constructor is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known as the formal type parameters of the constructor. The form of the formal type parameter list is identical to a type parameter list of a generic class or interface.

Below is a Java code illustrates a problem that exists when not using generics:

```java
List v = new ArrayList();
v.add("test");
Integer i = (Integer)v.get(0); // Run time error

```

Although the code is compiled without error, it throws a runtime exception (java.lang.ClassCastException) when executing the third line of code. This type of problem can be avoided by using generics and is the primary motivation for using generics.

Using generics, the above code fragment can be rewritten as follows:

```java
List<String> v = new ArrayList<>();
v.add("test");
Integer i = v.get(0); // (type error)  compilation-time error

```

With generics, it is no longer necessary to cast the third line to any particular type, because the result of v.get(0) is defined as String by the code generated by the compiler.

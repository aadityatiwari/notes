Description
-----

This repository contains my study notes mainly in markdown format on different topics related to Computer Science. The primary source of these contents are [Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org). The intent of sharing these summarized notes is to make it available to whosoever needs it for a quick reference.

### Directories

- **java**: Notes on different concepts related to Java programming language.

- **design-pattern**: Notes on formalized best practices and categories of software design patterns.

- **computer-architecture**: Notes on random topics related to computer systems architecture design and implementation.

- **computer-science**: Notes on range of topics from computer science discipline.
